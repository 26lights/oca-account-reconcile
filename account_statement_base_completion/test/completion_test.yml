  In order to test the banking framework, I first need to create a profile
-
  !record {model: account.statement.profile, id: profile_test1}:
    name: Bank EUR Profile
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    commission_account_id: account.a_expense
    company_id: base.main_company
    balance_check: True
    rule_ids:
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_4
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_5
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_2
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_3
-
  Now I create a statement
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement, id: statement_test1}:
    name: Statement 2
    profile_id: profile_test1
    company_id: base.main_company
    line_ids:
      - name: Test autocompletion based on Customer Invoice Number
        ref: CI0001
        date: '2013-12-20'
        amount: 210.0
      - name: Test autocompletion based on Supplier Invoice Number
        ref: T2S12345
        date: '2013-12-19'
        amount: -65.0
      - name: Test autocompletion based on Partner Name Vauxoo
        ref: /
        date: '2013-12-17'
        amount: 600.0
      - name: test autocompletion based on text (XXX66Z) matching with partner form information (note that Ref does not exist)
        ref: ZU788
        date: '2013-12-24'
        amount: -932.4
-
  I run the auto complete
-
  !python {model: account.bank.statement}: |
    result = self.button_auto_completion(cr, uid, [ref("statement_test1")])
